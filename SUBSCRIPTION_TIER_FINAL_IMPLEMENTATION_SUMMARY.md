# Subscription Tier System - Final Implementation Summary

## Overview
The subscription tier system has been successfully implemented to manage user access levels, application workflows, and community access within the Mbauni Protocol platform. This document summarizes the complete implementation and verifies that all requirements have been met.

## System Components

### 1. Database Schema
The system uses the `profiles` table with a `subscription_tier` column that supports the following values:
- `free` (default for new users)
- `foundation`
- `professional`
- `elite`
- `elite-pending` (for users awaiting admin approval)

Subscription history is tracked in the `subscription_history` table with automatic logging via database triggers.

### 2. Signup Process
- Users select their preferred subscription tier during signup
- OTP-based email verification replaces traditional verification links
- User metadata includes subscription tier information
- New users default to 'free' tier if no selection is made

### 3. User Routing
Based on subscription tier, users are directed to appropriate sections:
- `elite-pending`: Under Review page
- `free`/`foundation`: Community Hub
- `professional`/`elite`: Full Dashboard access

### 4. Admin Functionality
- Applications tab in Admin Portal displays pending applications (`elite-pending` users)
- Approve/Reject functionality updates user tiers and sends notifications
- Admins can manually change user tiers as needed

### 5. Community Access Control
- Community Hub implements tier-based access restrictions
- Free tier users have limited access to premium community groups
- Premium tier users gain access to exclusive groups and features

### 6. Notification System
- Automated notifications for application status changes
- Email notifications for approval/rejection
- Real-time notification delivery via Supabase realtime features
